/// Base class for value objects in Domain-Driven Design.
/// Value objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes rather than identity.
/// They implement equality based on all their properties and are replaceable.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Key characteristics of Value Objects:
/// - Immutable: Once created, their state cannot be changed
/// - No Identity: Two value objects with the same values are considered equal
/// - Replaceable: Can be replaced with another instance having the same values
/// - Self-validating: Should validate their own invariants
/// 
/// Examples: Money, Address, DateRange, Email, Phone Number
/// 
/// Usage:
/// 1. Inherit from this class
/// 2. Make all properties read-only (private set or init-only)
/// 3. Implement GetEqualityComponents() to return all properties used for equality
/// 4. Add validation in constructor to ensure invariants
/// </remarks>
